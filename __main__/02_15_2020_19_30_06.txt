Hello Everyone,


I drank a cup of water this weekend. To celebrate, we will be having a Math
Club Meeting (and some pizza)!


With a probability of 1, I won=E2=80=99t show up to class today because I h=
ave no
classes today. This example shows the power of applied probability. To
teach us more about this, we will be having *Professor Po-Shen Loh*
speaking to us this Wednesday (*2/12*) about *=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Applied=E2=
=80=99 Probability=E2=80=9D* from
*5:30PM-6:30PM* in Porter Hall 100 (*PH100*). For more info about the talk,
see abstract below! Some of you might know Professor Loh from Putnam
Seminar or from Expii or from his Instagram page @poshenloh. Regardless,
this talk has a high probability of being good.


There will also almost surely be pizza, so pull through for that if food is
something that mildly interests you (maybe your attendance is conditional
on the existence of food?).


Best,

Title: =E2=80=9CApplied=E2=80=9D Probability


Abstract: Probability is very useful=E2=80=A6 for proving facts in pure
mathematics! We=E2=80=99ll talk about some non-obvious applications of prob=
ability
which establish results in geometry and combinatorics.

*A Discussion with Kelauni Cook *- *Software developer and founder of Black
Tech Nation*
When: Tuesday  2/18  4:30-5:30pm
Where: Hamburg Hall 1007
Come learn more about Kelauni and her organization based right here in

if
you plan to come. Food will be provided.
We are approaching the time when first year students choose a major. To
celebrate, please join us on 2/26 from 4:30-6:00pm in Wean Hall 7316 . We
will provide food and beverages. Great if upper-class physics majors could
come and pass on wisdom. We are a community or at least striving to become
one, one that welcomes everybody and provides support for its members.
Please come join. And, oh yes, we will have the forms so that first year
students can declare at the party. Of course, of course, we do not have any
over/under bets on the number of first year students that will declare, but
we will certainly celebrate every declaration!
*Women in IS Mentoring Program*
When: Thursday  2/13  4:30-5:30pm
Where: Hamburg Hall 1006
We are excited to share with you that we are in the planning stages of
implementing a peer mentoring program for the women of IS! We have heard
feedback from many of you that you wish you had had a mentor as a
first-year student, and we know that peer mentoring programs can be
beneficial to both mentors and mentees. We are excited to get started!
In order to make this program work for students, we need your help. We are
hosting an informational brainstorming session on February 13th. We would
love to have input from as many of you as possible! Make your voice heard.
Food will be provided.

The L'Or=C3=A9al Brandstorm Case Study Competition is an innovation competi=
tion
open to all undergraduate students. This year's case is about building a
plastic-less future in the beauty industry!

As a part of this competition, students have the opportunity to receive
mentorship, and potentially compete in New York and Paris! The ultimate
prize? An intrapreneurship at Station F in Paris, the world's largest
startup incubator. At this workshop, you'll have the chance to learn more
about the competition, meet L'Or=C3=A9al Carnegie Mellon Alumni and start
working on your idea to win Brandstorm 2020! Food will be provided as well
as L'Or=C3=A9al product giveaways.
